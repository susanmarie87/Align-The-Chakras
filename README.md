Align The Chakras- MS2

Align The Chakras is a simple card matching game. In this game we have several rows of cards. We then have to flip over two cards at a time in
hopes of finding the match. In the event we do not choose the matching cards, our cards will automatically flip back over and we have
the chance to try again. The cards will automatically shuffle for the next round.
