#Bugs & errors 
If it could go wrong during this project, it went wrong. Where to begin. 

Originally I could not stop the hover effect over the cards. This extremely painful and month long issue was resolved with the help of my mentor Gerard McBride by adding an Onclick event to each card and putting the hover effect into a JavaScript function.

I got the cards working but the shuffle function would not work, no matter what I did. To solve this, I completely tossed the entire game and started anew.

I got the new game working. Everything was going smooth until gitpod did their marvelous unannounced update and what do you know? My enitre game stopped working. The repo would not show up in my workspace, forcing me to create a new instance everytime. So here we are, beginning again for the 832nd time. 

Deployment Align The Chakras has been deployed on GitHub Pages with the following process:

All code was written on Gitpod, a cloud-based IDE.

The code was then pushed to GitHub where it is stored in my Repository.

Under the Settings section of the GitHub repository, scroll down to GitHub Pages section.

Under 'Source' drop-down, the 'Master branch' was selected.

Once selected, this publishes the project to GitHub Pages and displays the site URL.

There is no difference between the deployed version and the development version.

The code can be run locally through clone or download. You can do this by opening the repository, clicking on the green 'Code' button and selecting either 'clone or download'.

The Clone option provides a URL, which you can use on your desktop IDE.

The Download ZIP option provides a link to download a ZIP file which can be unzipped on your local machine or uploaded to your cloud-based IDE workspace.
